1.  [Authentication](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication)

2.  [Authorization](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authorization)


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file. You can customize it the way you want :

`DB_PORT='5432'`

`DB_USERNAME='postgres'`

`DB_PASSWORD='root'`

`DB_DATABASE='authdemo'`








#### Q: How do I troubleshoot issues with authentication?
A: Check the console logs for error messages, ensure your environment variables are set correctly, and verify your database connection.

#### Q: Can I customize the authentication flow?
A: Yes, you can modify the authentication flow by editing the auth.controller.ts and auth.service.ts files.

#### Q: What if I encounter a "401 Unauthorized" error?

A: Ensure your JWT token is valid, not expired, and correctly formatted. Also, check your role-based access control settings.

#### Q: How do I handle errors when creating a new user?
A: Catch and handle errors thrown by the users.service.ts file, such as duplicate usernames or invalid input.

#### Q: Can I use this project with a different database?
A: Yes, you can modify the database.module.ts file to support a different database provider.

#### Q: What if I encounter a "500 Internal Server Error"?
A: Check the server logs for error messages, ensure your environment variables are set correctly, and verify your database connection.

## Lessons Learned

## Authorization with Enum Files:

Files Involved: role.enum.ts
- I learned that we can manage authorization effectively using enum files.
- By defining roles such as admin and user in role.enum.ts, we can then add an extra column, role, to an entity (e.g., user.entity.ts)
- This setup allows the database to recognize which entity has which role and apply the appropriate permissions.

## Defining Roles in DTOs:

Files Involved: create-user.dto.ts

- When creating Data Transfer Objects (DTOs), such as create-user.dto.ts, I included an additional attribute called role of type Role.
- This ensures that when creating a user, the backend expects the role to be part of the request structure.

## Role Decorator and Guard:

Files Involved: role.decorator.ts, roles.guard.ts

- To utilize the role variable, I created a role decorator (role.decorator.ts).
- This decorator is applied to routes, such as a signup route, and allows specifying which roles (e.g., user or admin) are required.

-  The role guard (roles.guard.ts) is then used to enforce these role requirements on the route.

## Issue with Global Auth Guard:

## Files Involved: auth.module.ts, auth.guard.ts
- I encountered an issue where signup and signin routes were not functioning correctly.
- The problem was that the authentication guard (auth.guard.ts) was registered globally in auth.module.ts, applying it to all routes.
- Since signup and signin should not require a token, this setup caused problems. The solution was to use a public decorator on the signup route, allowing access without restriction.

## JWT Payload and Role Encoding:

Files Involved: auth.service.ts, jwt.strategy.ts

- Another issue arose when I could not access route protected by the role decorator.
-  After investigation, I discovered that the JWT payload was only encoding the user ID and username, not the role.
-  As a result, the system could not verify the user's role.
-  To resolve this, I included the role in the JWT payload within auth.service.ts and updated jwt.strategy.ts accordingly.
- With this change, access to protected routes based on roles began functioning correctly.
